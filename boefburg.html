            <p><strong>Method</strong></p>
            <p>
                <br>Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over high heat, and then sear the beef in batches on all sides until dark brown. 
                <br>When done, set the meat aside in a plate for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Using the same pot, add a little more oil and sear the mushrooms until golden, 
                <br>then add the onions and let cook for about 5 minutes until they become lightly colored.
                <br>When done, remove from the pot and set aside.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, add the bacon to the pot and sear for a few minutes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Return the beef to the pot and mix in the tomato paste to enhance the colour.
                <br>Deglaze with the Madeira wine (optional) and leave to reduce for a minute before 
                <br>stirring in the toasted flour. Mix well to incorporate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Add the mushrooms, onions and bacon back to the pot and stir everything gently 
                <br>to distribute the garnish around.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Finish by emptying the bottle of wine into the pot, and if necessary, 
                <br>top up with water so that the liquid just about covers the meat. 
                <br>Then, add the rind, bouquet garni, carrots and garlic. Bring to a light boil 
                <br>and use a spoon to scoop off the foam that has accumulated on the surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>When ready, turn the heat off, cover the pot with a lid and place in the oven. 
                <br>Slow cook for 3 hours, undisturbed, until the beef is tender and can be easily 
                <br>pulled apart with a fork.
            </p>
            <p>
                When cooked, remove from the oven and adjust the seasoning if necessary. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Serve with potatoes, rice and some crusty bread for the sauce with 
                <br>a glass of red wine (of course). Bon appetit!
            </p>
