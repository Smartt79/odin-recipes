                <p>
                    <br>Dry-roast the onion and ginger in a frying pan over high heat. 
                    <br>Cook until the onion starts to blacken in some spots and the ginger is fragrant 
                    <br>and starting to colour. Add the cinnamon stick and star anise and cook for 
                    <br>a further minute or until fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>Place the chicken in a large pot. Cover with water and place over a medium-high heat. 
                    <br>Add the onion, ginger, spices, salt and fish sauce. Bring to a gentle simmer. 
                    <br>Use a ladle to scoop out and discard any foamy scum that rises to the surface. 
                    <br>Then reduce the heat to low and gently simmer for one hour, removing the foam from time to time. 
                    <br>Remove the chicken from the broth and place on a cutting board. You can test if the chicken is cooked 
                    <br>by inserting a skewer into the thigh. The juices should run clear. If not, place the chicken 
                    <br>back into the simmering broth and cook for another 15 minutes. When the chicken is cooked, 
                    <br>slice the meat and discard the bones. Set aside until ready to serve. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>Strain the broth and pour it back into a clean saucepan over medium-high heat. 
                    <br>Taste and season with extra salt and fish sauce (the amount of seasoning will depend on 
                    <br>the amount of water you needed at the start). I find at least 1 teaspoon of each 
                    <br>is usually needed for the best flavour. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>To serve, cook the noodles in boiling water until tender and divide among serving bowls. 
                    <br>Top with the chicken meat and slices of onion. Ladle over the hot broth. 
                    <br>Add spring onion and bean shoots. Serve with basil leaves, lime wedges and chilli slices.
